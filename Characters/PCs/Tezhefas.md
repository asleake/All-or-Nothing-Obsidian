Orc Cleric. Mid 50s, handsome by Orc standards - heavily scarred, both ritualistically and from battles.

Has been a member of the investigative force for a while, but was somewhat shady. In advertently helped out slavers.
Died in the [[Murder Den]] and was resurrected by [[Sarenrae]], who gave him the charge to free others.
Met the team while on his own investigation into the [[Doomsday Device]]
