Stole the [[Doomsday Device]]. Worked as a guard at the [[Casino]] for about a month, but left suddenly about two weeks before our [[Casino Infiltration]].

Lives in a brown manor, on the 3rd floor. We went to try to open the door, but [[Tasselock Hoffuholmes]] notices that there's a trap. Upon opening, nothing appears to happen, but there is an audible click.

Her room was full of newsclippings. Think Pepe Silvia. 

Some portion of the wall is newly plastered. Looks to be a wall between two apartments. On the other side, there are a couple of tanks leading to nozzles in the ceiling. It looks like there's a timer or something. Acid/poison rain goes off and we attempt to stop it while protecting the evidence.
